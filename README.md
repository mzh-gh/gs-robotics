# gs-robotics
This repo contains some school projects from my robotics class. They're generally pretty small and only took a few hours of time to make, so I decided to put them all in one repository.

## Pinecone
Pinecone is a "rock-paper-scissors engine": it analyzes your moves and can beat human players pretty consistently. Read the comments in pinecone.ino for more info.

## Tetris
This is a clone of Tetris (NES).

## Wordle
This is a rudimentary clone of Wordle.
